# Batman: Arkham Asylum - Advanced Launcher

This is a replacement application for the original BmLauncher of the game. Alongside the vastly superior configuration options, this Launcher also offers:

- Tooltips for every setting
- Option to disable Startup Movies
- Compatibility Fixes for [HD Texture Packs](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1159691355)
- NVIDIA Implementation (Enable HBAO+ in the Launcher! NVIDIA Inspector not needed!)

Works with both the Steam and EGS Version!

**This Application depends on .NET Framework 4.5**. If you are using Windows 8 (or newer), you shouldn't have any issues executing it. Windows 7 SP1 (and older) might have to install [.NET Framework 4.5](https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/A/4/BA4A7E71-2906-4B2D-A0E1-80CF16844F5F/dotNetFx45_Full_setup.exe) manually.

## Download

See: [Current Release](https://github.com/neatodev/BmLauncher/releases)

## Installation

Drag the BmLauncher.exe into the 'Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY\Binaries' folder.

To find this folder for the *Steam* version, just right-click the game in Steam, select Properties->Local Files->Browse Local Files.

Since *EGS* doesn't have an option like this, your best bet is to just open your C:\Program Files\ folder and look for the installation there.


## Usage

You can just launch your game via Steam or EGS as you normally would, though in some cases you might need to unblock this application for it to work properly.

To do that, just right-click the application, select Properties and enable the highlighted checkbox as seen in the image below:

## Bug Reports

To file a bug report, or if you have suggestions for the Launcher in general, please file an [issue](https://github.com/neatodev/BmLauncher/issues/new). I read these regularly and should normally be able to respond within a day.

## About this Project

This is my first programming project using C#. I created it in the span of a few days for multiple, ultimately irrelevant reasons. So for any fellow coder looking through the source code, expect bad practice, messy implementations, lots of static variables and Java naming conventions and patterns. I might clean up the code in the future, but as it stands it works just fine and I am occupied with other projects. For anyone who seeks to criticize my code, please keep this in mind.
