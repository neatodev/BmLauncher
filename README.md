# Batman: Arkham Asylum - Advanced Launcher

This is a replacement application for the original BmLauncher of the game. Alongside the vastly superior configuration options, this Launcher also offers:

- Tooltips for every setting
- Option to disable Startup Movies
- Compatibility Fixes for HD Texture Packs
- NVIDIA Implementation. (Enable HBAO+ in the Launcher! NVIDIA Inspector not needed!)

Works with both the Steam and EGS Version!

**This Application depends on .NET Framework 4.5**. If you are a Windows 8 (or newer) user, you shouldn't have any issues executing it. Windows 7 SP1 (and older) might have to install [Net Framework 4.5](https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/A/4/BA4A7E71-2906-4B2D-A0E1-80CF16844F5F/dotNetFx45_Full_setup.exe) manually.

## Download

See: [Current Release](https://github.com/neatodev/BmLauncher/releases)

## Installation

Drag the BmLauncher.exe into the 'steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY\Binaries' folder.


## Usage

Just start the game through Steam or EGS as you usually would. No changes here!
